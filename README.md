# 🧩 Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement an intelligent **User, Group, and Role Management System** integrated with **Access Control** and **Workflow Automation** using the **ServiceNow platform**.  
The system simplifies user operations, enhances data security, and automates workflows for efficient task management and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Streamline creation and management of users, groups, and roles.  
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to prevent unauthorized operations.  
- Automate workflow approvals and task assignments.  
- Maintain audit trails for transparency and compliance.  
- Improve administrative efficiency through automation and optimization.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **User, Group, and Role Management** — Create, update, and manage records with structured hierarchies.  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** — Secure access based on user roles and permissions.  
- **Workflow Automation** — Automate task assignments, approvals, and escalations using Flow Designer.  
- **Audit & Logging System** — Maintain complete activity logs for accountability.  
- **Dynamic Dashboards** — Monitor user roles, workflow status, and access patterns in real time.  
- **User Impersonation Testing** — Verify role access and workflows under real user profiles.

## 🚀 System Workflow
1. **Create Users and Groups** → Define hierarchy and roles.  
2. **Assign Roles & Permissions** → Configure ACLs for each user type.  
3. **Automate Workflows** → Use Flow Designer for approvals and role requests.  
4. **Test & Validate** → Impersonate users and verify ACL restrictions.  
5. **Monitor & Audit** → Generate dashboards and access logs for analysis.
